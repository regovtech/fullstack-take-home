# Welcome to this PopQuiz!
### { "Engineer": "FullStack" }

Hey! We are excited that you are interested in joining the team at Regov Technologies.

We feel that the best place to really show us your skills is somewhere you feel comfortable. This test should not take you a long amount of time to complete.

Demonstrate your problem solving skills and understanding of core data structures by attempting both questions. The questions are open to interpretation and implementation.

### Coding Challenge

Build a simple user registration portal. The registration process requires three steps.

1. Collect user credentials (full name, age, address, employment, job, etc)
2. A placeholder to upload international passport or national identity card. Then the placeholder should display the upload.
3. A final preview of all inputs (credentials and upload) before submission.
4. During preview, a user should be able to update the inputs or re-upload a new image.
4. After a successful account creation, a user will be able to login and logout

### User Stories (Requirements)

- As a user I can register on the app.
- As a user I can login and logout with my approved credentials
- As a user I can upload my international passport or identity card.
- As a user I can preview my inputs and edit on the same page before submitting my registration.
- As a user I can access the app on different screen sizes
- As a user I can login to view my registration submission
- As a user I can edit submitted information anytime.
- As an admin i can login, view applications, approve or deny
- As a system all data should be protected on rest and in transit
- As a system my screen loads fast, and shows only necessary contents

Feel free to go above and beyond if you have ideas for extra features!
